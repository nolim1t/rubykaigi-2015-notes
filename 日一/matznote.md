* Minaswan "Matz is Nice And So We Are Nice"- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINASWAN
* New ruby 2.3 will be release on December 25th according to Matz
* Highlights: "Did you mean" in the compiler
* Features: Event Driven Programming, Enumerable#grep_v, Hash#fetch_values, Numeric#positive?, Numeric#negative?, Hash comparisons (<=, <, >=, >), Array#dig, Hash#dig
* Ruby 2.3 is faster
* Ruby is now a community effort thanks to many committers (Open Source)
* mruby 1.2 released in November. Bugfixes. More stable
* Don't make something people want, make something what people need
* Create something that has never existed.
* Design is hard because the future is unknown
* Back in 1995 when Ruby was released, people said that we don't need OO for scripting. (see Henry Ford's quote "If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses." )
* You need an OO approach because the Human Brain can easily process it.
* People didn't see the need for OO, but Matz didn't care.
* After 10 years Ruby became the new normal
* Programming languages last longer. Ruby was released in 1995, but software released in 1995 was Windows 95 which noone used anymore.
* Multilingualization was released in 2004
* 1.9.0 was released in 2007
* Ruby has done better than Python 3, no one suggested to give up at least
* Ruby doesn't throw away everything. It just replaces one piece of functionality at a time (and test). Prepared migration path.
* Ruby has a nice compatibility between 1.9 and 2.0 - lesson learnt from 1.8 to 1.9
* Ruby 3 will have concurrency and multi-core
